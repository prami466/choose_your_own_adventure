Adventure Game
This Python script is a simple text-based adventure game. The player is prompted to make decisions at various points in the game by typing responses. Based on the player's choices, different outcomes are generated, leading to either winning or losing the game.

Here's how it works:

Introduction: The game welcomes the player by asking for their name.
Initial Choice: The player chooses to go left or right on a dirt road.
Left Path: Leads to a river where the player decides to walk around or swim across.
Walking leads to running out of water.
Swimming leads to being eaten by an alligator.
Right Path: Leads to a wobbly bridge where the player decides to cross it or head back.
Heading back results in losing the game.
Crossing the bridge leads to meeting a stranger, where the player decides to talk to them or not.
Talking to the stranger results in winning gold.
Ignoring the stranger leads to losing the game.
Invalid Options: Any invalid responses result in losing the game.
Conclusion: The game ends with a thank you message to the player.
